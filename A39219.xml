            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO THE DESERTION DISCUSS'D.</head>
            <p>IF many of our Long-Rob'd Divines, puft up with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their own Parts, would but keep clo≈øer to their Texts, and their Duties, mo≈øt certainly our Peace and Union would be much firmer, and more a≈ø≈øured then it is. For being ≈øway'd by Intere≈øt and Profit, they are more afraid of lo≈øing the Advantages of Earthly Preferment, then the Trea≈øures of Heavenly Felicity. Unle≈øs they ≈øwim in their own Wi≈øhes and De≈øires, all Things are out of Order. The Church is in danger, they cry; here are <hi>Sharers</hi> coming in among Us: And by an odd kind of Eccle≈øia≈øtical Policy, ≈øeem rather inclinable to return under the Yoke of Popery, then to endure the Equality of a Di≈ø≈øenting Prote≈øtant; rather to be at the check of a Pope's Nuncio, then ≈øuffer the Fraternity of a Prote≈øtant Nonconformi≈øt. They ≈øaid nothing to the late King, till he began to touch their Copy-holds: then they call'd out for Help; and now they are angry with their Relief, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are afraid of well they know not what. And this is their Misfortune, that if all things an≈øwer not the full Height of their Expectations, they are the fir≈øt that ≈øhould be la≈øt di≈ø≈øatisfied. If all things go not well, as they imagine, they
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41592:3"/> pre≈øently grow moody and wa≈øpi≈øh; and while they in≈øinuate their empty Notions into others, who admiring the fluency of their Pulpit Language, either out of Ignorance, or Lazine≈øs, allow them a Prerogative over their Under≈øtandings, the whole Nation mu≈øt be embroyl'd by their Surmi≈øes and Mi≈øtru≈øts.</p>
            <p>El≈øe what had that Gentleman, who wrote the <hi>De≈øertion Di≈øcu≈øs'd,</hi> to do to bu≈øy his Brains with a <hi>Subject,</hi> neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to his Function, nor proper for his Talent?

               </gap>re≈øervation. For certainly never was a fairer Pro≈øpect then now, ≈øince the many Revolutions under which the Briti≈øh Monarchy has labour'd, of its being re≈øtor'd to its ancient Grandeur and Renown, and of enjoying the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Peace and Pro≈øperity in a higher mea≈øure then ever. So that it mu≈øt be look'd upon as the Effect, either of a mo≈øt pernicious Malice, or a ≈øtrange di≈øtraction of Brain, for ≈øuch <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øers</hi> as the≈øe, to be throwing about the Darnel of their nice and froward Conceptions, on purpo≈øe to choak the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of ≈øo glorious a Harve≈øt. For they mu≈øt be Men that want the government of right Rea≈øon within them≈øelves, as being en≈ølav'd either to vicious Cu≈øtom, or partial Affection, or el≈øe they would never run them≈øelves and others with ≈øo much precipitancy, into the ≈øhame and ignominy of upholding the ≈øubvertors of National Con≈øtitutions. And all this to blacken and defame the noble Endeavours, and prudent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels of tho≈øe renowned Patriots that pur≈øu'd the only means to re≈øcue a langui≈øhing Monarchy from impending Thraldom and Ruin.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He does not wonder,</hi> he ≈øays, <hi>that a Man of ≈øo much ≈øen≈øe and integrity as his Friend is, ≈øhould be ≈øurprized at the Thrones being declared Vacant by the Lower Hou≈øe of Convention. For how,</hi> ≈øays his Friend, <hi>can the Seat of the Government be empty, while the King, who all grant, had an unque≈øtionable Title, is ≈øtill liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> here forgot, that it had been the re≈øolv'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41592:3"/> Opinion of two Parliaments already, That there was no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for the Prote≈øtant Religion, the King's Life, or the e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øh'd Government of the Kingdom, without pa≈ø≈øing a Bill for di≈øabling the Duke of <hi>York</hi> to inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that unle≈øs a Bill were pa≈øs'd for excluding the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> the Hou≈øe could not give any Supply to the King, without Danger to his per≈øon, the Hazard of the Prote≈øtant Religion, and Breach of the Tru≈øt in them repos'd by the People. Upon which a Bill did pa≈øs the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and was ≈øent up to the Lords for their Concurrence, by which <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> was excluded and made for ever uncapable to Inherit, Po≈ø≈øe≈øs or Enjoy the Imperial Crown of this Realm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he adjudg'd Guilty of High Trea≈øon, and to ≈øuffer the Pains and Penalties as in Ca≈øe of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, if after ≈øuch a Time he ≈øhould claim, challenge, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to po≈ø≈øe≈øs or exerci≈øe any Authority or Juri≈ødiction, as King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in any of the ≈øaid Dominions. 'Tis true, the Lords did not pa≈øs this Bill, for Rea≈øons well known; yet was it ≈øuch a mutilation to the Duke's Title, to be di≈øabled from ≈øucceeding in the Kingdom, by the whole Body of the Commons, who are the Repre≈øentatives of the Nation, that it can never be ≈øaid, that all Men <hi>granted his Title unque≈øtionable,</hi> as the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> impo≈øes upon the World. Be≈øides the many In≈øtances in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtory, of ≈øeveral Princes who have forfeited their Succe≈ø≈øion, and con≈øequently their Title to the Crown, for revolting from the E≈øtabli≈øh'd Religion of the Realm.</p>
            <p>But, ≈øays the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer,</hi> for I look upon his Friend and Him to be all one; (and that he does but put the Que≈øtion with one ≈øide of his Mouth, and an≈øwer it with the other) <hi>I had thought our Laws, as well as our Religion, had been again≈øt the Depo≈øing Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That's not the Que≈øtion; but whether a Prince may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit tho≈øe Mi≈øcarriages in Government, whether he may not ≈øo far, <hi>peccare in Leges &amp; Rempublicam,</hi> as to incur the Forfeiture of his Regal Power? and whether a Prince may be allow'd to ≈øubvert the ancient Con≈øtitutions and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of a Nation, and yet be ≈øaid to be the Lawful King of that Realm? The≈øe are the Que≈øtions: For then it is not the Law that depo≈øes him, nor the Religion that ju≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it. But it is He that depo≈øes Him≈øelf: 'tis the bad Advice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41592:4"/> of Evil Coun≈øellors to which he Li≈øtens, and which he follows to the ruin of the Kingdom, contrary to the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Contract between Princes and People, grounded upon the Foundations of all Original Government; I ≈øay, 'tis that Adhering to Evil Coun≈øel which depo≈øes a Prince by degrading him from a Lawful King to an Unlawful Tyrant, and renders him Liable to the Animadver≈øion of the Law, and the impeachments of the oppre≈øs'd and injur'd People. To a≈ø≈øert otherwi≈øe were to deprive all National Law and Religion of their ≈øelf Defence; which is again≈øt all the Law and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World. I am apt to believe that Chri≈øt him≈øelf had no very good Opinion of the lawfulne≈øs of <hi>Herod</hi>'s Regality, when he ≈øent him that Me≈ø≈øage, <hi>Go tell that Fox, Herod:</hi> Which I look upon as a Depo≈øal and Degrading of that Arbitrary Prince by the Founder of our Religion, in his own Brea≈øt and Judgment, though he forbore the Execution of his Cele≈øtial Power. And therefore it is not the Error of Religion, but the Fault of tho≈øe that do not well di≈øtingui≈øh, that Religion ≈øuffers in her Doctrines. For only he who governs according to Law is a King, he that endeavours to ≈øubvert the Law, is none. Nor is every rambling and precipitate Brain to be Judg of this neither, but the Solid Law, and fundamental Con≈øtitutions of the Realm. So that the Country Gentleman was mi≈øtaken in his Thoughts, both of our Laws and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. However the pretended Scrupulous Country Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man de≈øires the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer to expound the State-Riddle of the Vacan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and to give him the Ground of the late extraordinary Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> gives no direct an≈øwer at pre≈øent, but de≈øires his Friend to take notice, <hi>That the Gentlemen of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, who declar'd a Vacancy in the Government, lay'd the main Stre≈øs of their opinion upon the King's withdrawing him≈øelf. For that ≈øince the Story of the French League, and the Bu≈øine≈øs of the Prince of</hi> Wales <hi>were pa≈øs'd over in ≈øilence, mo≈øt Men believed that the pretended Breach of that which they called the Original Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was no more then a popular Flouri≈øh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which is ≈øuch an imperfect peice of Incoherence, that none but a madman would have thru≈øt in by Head and Should<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> has done. For how can it be inferr'd that the <hi>Breach of the Original Contract,</hi> ≈øhould be a <hi>Popular</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:41592:4"/> 
               <hi>Flouri≈øh,</hi> becau≈øe the Clande≈øtin League, and the <hi>Fal≈øe Birth</hi> are hitherto pa≈øs'd over in ≈øilence? As for the <hi>≈øurreptitious Birth,</hi> one would think it was ≈øufficiently dilated upon in the Declaration of the Lords; and why it is not farther brought upon the Stage, there may be ≈øeveral Rea≈øons given; and among the re≈øt, becau≈øe it may be thought that the Impo≈øture will vani≈øh of it ≈øelf, and ≈øo there will be no need of ca≈øting an Eternal Blot upon the memory of them that contriv'd and own'd it. Then for the Clande≈øtin League, it Suffices that there is apparent Proof of it in Bank. But to call the Breach of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Contract <hi>pretended,</hi> and a <hi>Popular Flouri≈øh,</hi> is a yerk of Malitious Reflection, which only ≈øerves to expo≈øe the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> to Publick cen≈øure. For as there is nothing more certain, then that there is an Original Contract between the King and People of <hi>England,</hi> the Breach of which has co≈øt the Effu≈øion of ≈øo much Blood; ≈øo is it as certain that that Original Contract was never ≈øo infallibly broken then it was of late. Which as it is allow'd by all the Laws of God and Man, to be a ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ground to ≈øeek a Remedy; ≈øo was nothing more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly urg'd by the Convention. Which might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer,</hi> that they did not pretend it for a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Flouri≈øh.</p>
            <p>But now, le≈øt the Country Gentleman ≈øhould <hi>be ≈øhogg'd by ≈øeeing the Votes of ≈øo con≈øiderable a Meeting, debated by a private Hand;</hi> the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> reminds him, <hi>That a Parliament and a Convention are two different Things. The latter, for want of the King's Writs and Concurrence, having no ≈øhare in the Legi≈ølative Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> forgets, that it was only a Convention of Lords that ≈øent to <hi>Richard</hi> the Second to meet them at <hi>We≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min≈øter;</hi> which the King at fir≈øt promis'd to do; but upon altering his Mind, ≈øent him another peremptory Me≈ø≈øage, that if he would not come according to his Promi≈øe, they would chu≈øe another King; and then proceeding farther, according to that Power they had, expell'd again≈øt the King's Will ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his chiefe≈øt Favourites from the Court; con≈øtrain'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to put in Sureties to appear at the next Parliament, and caus'd ≈øeveral others to be arre≈øted and committed to ≈øeveral Pri≈øons. If a Convention could do this where the King was pre≈øent, what ≈øignifi'd the Writs and Concurrence of an
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41592:5"/> ab≈øent Prince. Nor did they contend for Legi≈ølative Power, but only met in a kind of embodied Dictator≈øhip to take care of the pre≈øent Nece≈ø≈øity of Affairs.</p>
            <p>But this, ≈øays the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer, was not ju≈øtifiable, for that <hi>the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øity which they pretended, was either of their own making, or of their own ≈øubmitting to, which is the ≈øame Thing.</hi> But this is all Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence. For if the Nece≈ø≈øity was of their own making, then were the Lords and Commons the Authors of all the Mi≈øcarriages which they laid to the late King's Charge; If of their own ≈øubmitting to, then would they never have call'd out for ≈øuccour and crav'd Relief from their Oppre≈ø≈øions. No‚ÄîThey were tho≈øe crying Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ≈øum'd up in the Declaration of the Lords Spiritual and Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Commons a≈ø≈øembl'd at <hi>We≈øtmi≈øter</hi> pre≈øented to their Pre≈øent Maje≈øties upon the Twelfth of February La≈øt; which when the late King could not ju≈øtify them by force of Arms, but fled for it, not being able to an≈øwer his endeavours to ≈øubvert and Extirpate the Prote≈øtant Religion and the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, put them to that nece≈ø≈øity of a≈ø≈øembling after an Unu≈øual Manner, to provide for the Common Safety.</p>
            <p>How ever the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer will have it a Nece≈ø≈øity of their own creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, tho never ≈øo fal≈øe. <q>For, ≈øays he, if the King had either not bin driven out of his Dominions, or invited back upon honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Terms, they needed not have had recour≈øe to ≈øuch unu≈øual ≈øingular Methods of proceeding.</q> And thus the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer rambles out of one Untruth into another. For he fled from offer'd Treaty, for≈øook the defence of his own Forces, and left them to be disbanded in Arrears and without Payment; ≈ølipt from his own Council by Night, after he had appointed to meet them in Con≈øultation the next Morning. Nor could he ju≈øtly ≈øu≈øpect, that any Violence would have been offer'd to Him in particular, being ≈øo well a≈ø≈øur'd as he could not choo≈øe but be, of the Generous Inclination, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Re≈øpect which the Prince had to his Per≈øon. But if the Guilt of peculiar Mi≈øcarriages ha≈øten'd his Departure, or over≈øway'd him toleave the He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>m of Rule without any Form or Face of Goverment: That could ne're be call'd an Expul≈øion out of his Dominions. And therefore when a certain Gentleman waiting on him at <hi>Fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øham</hi> be≈øought him to return to <hi>London,</hi> he gave the Per≈øon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>That he was an hone≈øt Gentleman, but knew not what he knew.</hi> And when he had once abandon'd the Kingdom all forlorn without either Head or Conduct, without Council, or any Countenance of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41592:5"/> Authority, then according to the Judgment of the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> in reference to the Succe≈ø≈øion of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Nobility and chief Per≈øons of the Land, as they are the chief Defence of the Royal Authority, to take care of the Publick Safety, whether by u≈øual or unu≈øual Methods of proceeding it matters not; and they have both <hi>the Authority</hi> of Law and Nece≈ø≈øity to ju≈øtify their Proceedings.</p>
            <p>As for his being <hi>invited back upon Honourable Terms,</hi> 'tis well known how he return'd back, and went through the City on the Sunday Night, attended by his own Guards, and lodg'd in <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and this mo≈øt certainly in order to an Accommodation. Only becau≈øe the Prince was coming to Town, he was ≈øent to, and for the avoiding any Di≈øturbance that might be prejudicial to his Per≈øon, was humbly de≈øir'd to retire to <hi>Ham-</hi>Hou≈øe, with Liberty to make choice of what Per≈øons he thought fit to attend him. Which he promi≈øed to do; but recollecting him≈øelf, and de≈øiring to know whether he might not return back to <hi>Roche≈øter,</hi> word was ≈øent him the next Morning that he might do as he pleas'd. All this while here was no Con≈øtraint put upon him; ≈øo that he could not be ≈øaid to be driven out of his. Dominions, but that it was his own Choice to for≈øake it.</p>
            <p>Notwith≈øtanding all this, The <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> will undertake to prove, <q>That the King before his withdrawing had ≈øufficient Grounds to make him apprehen≈øive of Danger, and therefore it could not be call'd an <hi>Abdication.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But through the whole Pur≈øuit of his Argument, the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> mo≈øt wretchedly mi≈øtakes the Point, quite mi≈øtaking the Effects for the Cau≈øes. For, ≈øays he, <q>Had not the King great Rea≈øon to retire to ≈øecure his Per≈øon and his Honour, when he had met with ≈øo many unfortunate Di≈øappointments, with ≈øo many ≈øurpri≈øing and unparallel'd Accidents? When part of the Army was revolted, and the Remainder too apparently un≈øerviceable; When the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had ≈øuch fatal and unremoveable Prejudices again≈øt his Service? When there were ≈øuch terrible Di≈øorders in the Kingdom, and all Places were either flaming or ready to take Fire? What ≈øhould a Prince do when he had ≈øcarce any thing left him to lo≈øe but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, but con≈øult his Safety, and give way to the irre≈øi≈øtable Evil?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The≈øe are very great Di≈øappointments and evil Accidents indeed to befal a Prince. But the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> forgets to tell ye, That the Prince
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:41592:6"/> brought all the≈øe Inconveniencies upon him≈øelf. The <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> tells ye that part of the Army revolted, but he omits to tell ye, that it was out of a Generous Principle, for that being Prote≈øtants, they would not embrue their Hands in the Blood of their Fellow. Prote≈øtants and Countreymen, nor be In≈øtruments to en≈ølave the Nation. He tells ye of terrible Di≈øorders in the Kingdom; but does not tell ye, it was time for the People to be in Di≈øorder, when they ≈øaw ≈øuch In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments upon their Ancient Franchi≈øes, ≈øuch Inundations of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery flowing in upon their Con≈øciences, and ≈øuch a rapid Violence of French Thraldom tumbling in upon their Necks. He complains that all Places were either flaming or ready to take Fire, but forgets to tell you who were the Incendiaries.</p>
            <p>The≈øe therefore, with ≈øeveral others of the ≈øame Nature, being the true Cau≈øes that drew the fore≈øaid Inconveniencies upon the King, it follows, that tho the Secondary Con≈øtraint of his withdrawing might be occa≈øion'd by the Effects, yet the Primary Cau≈øe of his withdrawing proceeded from the Fir≈øt Cau≈øes which produced the Effects. Con≈øequently ≈øuch a Retiring was voluntary and not forc'd; becau≈øe he may be ju≈øtly ≈øaid to fly from ≈øomething of dreaded Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment, rather then pur≈øuing Danger, from which he was always at a di≈øtance far enough off, but dubious what would become of him as to the Former.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> makes many other grievous Complaints to ju≈øtify the King's Fir≈øt withdrawing (for hitherto he is altogether upon that) but when he comes to ≈øum up all. <q>In ≈øhort, ≈øays he, when the Forts and Revenue were thus di≈øpo≈øed of; when the Papi≈øts were to be disbanded, and the Prote≈øtants not to be tru≈øted; when the Nation was under ≈øuch general and violent Di≈ø≈øatisfactions; when the King in ca≈øe of a Rupture had nothing upon the matter but his ≈øingle Per≈øon, to oppo≈øe again≈øt the Princes Arms, and tho≈øe of his Subjects; when his Mortal Enemies were to ≈øit Judges of his Crown and Dignity, if no father; when Affairs were in this tempe≈øtuous Condition, to ≈øay that a Free and Indifferent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be cho≈øen, with the Relation to the King's Right as well as the People's, and that the King had no ju≈øt vi≈øible Cau≈øe to apprehend him≈øelf in Danger, is to out-face the Sun and trample upon the Under≈øtandings, and almo≈øt upon the Sen≈øes of the whole Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Fortified Towns, it was but Rea≈øon that his then Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> who came over to re≈øcue the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41592:6"/> from Arbitrary Violence and Oppre≈ø≈øion, ≈øhould demand them to be put into his Power, well Knowing them to be then in the Hands of <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Papi≈øts and Cut-Throats, of whom the People ≈øtood in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Fear, and who were rather a Con≈øternation then Security to the Kingdom. And the ≈øame rea≈øon holds in Relation to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. For all the World knows, what Va≈øt Sums had been Squander'd away by the late King, when Duke, to keep off the ≈øitting of Parliaments, and to buy off the Members when they Sate; and when that Money was ≈øpent ≈øo much to the Detriment of the Realm, what Sollicitations were made to the French King for more, to carry on the Popi≈øh Cau≈øe and Intere≈øt. It was as well known how the Revenue had of late Years been Embezl'd to keep up a ≈øtanding Army of <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Ragamuffins; as if <hi>England</hi> were now in its Turn to have been conquer'd by <hi>Ireland,</hi> as formerly <hi>Ireland</hi> had been conquer'd by <hi>England.</hi> From which fears when his pre≈øent Maje≈øty had delivered the Nation, it was but rea≈øon that his Army ≈øhould be pay'd out of the Publick Stock for their happy Toyl and labour. For the Publick Revenue of all Kingdoms and States was ever Originally intended for the Pre≈øervation, and not the De≈øtruction of the People.</p>
            <p>Upon the Disbanding of the Papi≈øts, the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> makes a ≈øpecial Ob≈øervation, <hi>That no Te≈øt-Acts nor any Others could barr the King from Li≈øting them as Common Souldiers.</hi> This perhaps may be true; that is to ≈øay, that a Prote≈øtant Prince may li≈øt Papi≈øts, and a Popi≈øh Prince Prote≈øtants, to follow him in a lawful War. But when a Popi≈øh Prince in a Prote≈øtant Nation had made his chiefe≈øt Levies of Popi≈øh Common Souldiers to over-aw his Prote≈øtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and put his ≈øole Confidence in them for his known and open De≈øigns and manife≈øt Endeavors to introduce Popery into a Prote≈øtant Kingdom, contrary to the Law, 'twas time then to think of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding ≈øuch Vermin, and ridding them out of the Land. And the rea≈øon why the Prote≈øtants could not be tru≈øted was as certain. For if the King would not tru≈øt his Prote≈øtants, nay di≈øarm'd them, when Papi≈øts were both arm'd and Employ'd, what rea≈øon had the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtants to tru≈øt the King. And this was that which among other Things created and fo≈øter'd tho≈øe <hi>General and Violent Di≈ø≈øatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions</hi> in the Nation. For Men have naturally a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>violent</hi> Antipathy again≈øt having their Throats Cut if they can help it. And therefore ≈øince the Kingdom by a Miraculous Providence had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd its Redemption, 'tis to be wonder'd the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer ≈øhould i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41592:7"/>
'twas ever intended that the late K. ≈øhould be in a Condition again to oppo≈øe either his own or the per≈øons of any others again≈øt the Arms of the Prince or tho≈øe of his own Subjects. And whereas, he ≈øays, that the King's Mortal Enemies were to be the Judges of his Crown and Dignity, the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer ≈øhould have done well before he had made his Reflection upon ≈øo many Eminent Patriots, to have con≈øulted <hi>Grotius, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>Par.</hi> 8. and the Example of <hi>Pau≈øamias</hi> King of <hi>Lacedamon</hi> there cited. Certainly there was no ≈øuch Impo≈ø≈øibility but that a Free and Indifferent Parliament might have been cho≈øen to deal equally between the King and the People. For tho the King perhaps might be con≈øcious that he could not ≈øo well rely upon the Kindne≈øs of tho≈øe to whom he had always had ≈øuch an inveterate Antipathy, yet he might have rely'd upon the Ju≈øtice of ≈øo many Great and Worthy Per≈øonages. So that it is the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer him≈øelf who out-faces the Sun and tramples upon the Under≈øtandings and Sen≈øes of the whole Nation, who makes the≈øe little Rhetorical Flouri≈øhes to palliate and ob≈øcure the Truth, and to in≈øinuate among the People, as if Wrong and Inju≈øtice had been done, where nothing was acted but what was a due debt to Self-Pre≈øervation. And with the ≈øame Brazening the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer out-faces the Sun, and tramples up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sen≈øes of the Nation, to a≈ø≈øert that a De≈øertion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, after ≈øuch Propo≈øals, which were rather A≈ø≈øurances of his Safety, was no De≈øertion. He had been ≈øafer in the Affection of the People, when all his evil Coun≈øellers had been remov'd from about him; he had been ≈øafer from the Importunities of his Prie≈øts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuites; He had been more ≈øecure from running him≈øelf into farther danger, and ≈øafer in the Enjoyment of his Royal Dignity. But he who had ≈øo Solemnly ≈øworn to E≈øtabli≈øh Popery in <hi>England</hi> or die in the Attempt, thought him≈øelf no where ≈øafe perhapps, but where he might be procuring his future Bli≈øs, by the Performance of his Vow.</p>
            <p>The Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer now advances to the King's ≈øecond withdrawing, and puts the Que≈øtion, <hi>what the King had done to incar a forfeiture by his fir≈øt Retirement?</hi> Indeed what had he not done? If the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> forgot in his Di≈øcu≈ø≈øing Heat, the <hi>Declaration</hi> pre≈øented to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Maje≈øties would have rubb'd up his Memory. Among the re≈øt there was one, <hi>That he had endeavoured to Subvert and Extirpate the Prote≈øtant Religion, and the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, by rai≈øing and keeping a Standing Army in the Kingdom in time of Peace, without Con≈øent of Parliament, and quartering Souldiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41592:7"/> to Law; and by cau≈øing ≈øeveral of his good Subjects to be Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd at the ≈øame time when Papi≈øts were b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>th Arm'd and Employ'd.</hi> Now to what purpo≈øe was all this, but to Subject the Kingdom to the Tyranny of the Pope? In ≈øuch a ca≈øe <hi>Barelay</hi> cited by <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>per.</hi> 10. gives this for his Opinion, <hi>Si Rex regnum alinet, aut alij Subjiciat, amitti ab eo Regnum.</hi> To which <hi>Grotius</hi> him≈øelf adds, <hi>Si Rex reip≈øa tradere regnum aut Subjicere molliatur, quin ei re≈øi≈øti in hoc po≈ø≈øe non dubite. Alind e≈øt enim Imperium, aliud habendi modus; qui no mutetur, ob≈øtare pote≈øt Populus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this, it cannot be imagin'd that the King returned the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time <hi>with an intention to govern;</hi> unle≈øs he might govern at his own will and Plea≈øure as he did before. But that would not be ≈øuffer'd him; for they who had now avoided the Yoke ≈øo near putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Necks, would never endure it ≈øhould come ≈øo near their ≈øhoulders again. Therefore all the Probality in the World is on this ≈øide, That the King perceiving, that by taking the Goverment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him again, he ≈øhould not be able to attain tho≈øe Ends which he had made the Bu≈øine≈øs of his whole Reign, re≈øolv'd to relinqui≈øh it altogether. At which time being at liberty to go or ≈øtay, his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be accounted Voluntary, and con≈øequently an Ab≈øolute <hi>Abdication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>La≈øtly, it is impo≈ø≈øible that the King could be frighted out of his Dominions, by the making of two or three Addre≈ø≈øes to his then Royal Highne≈øs the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> for it was no more than rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally he could expect would be done; more e≈øpecially from the <hi>City</hi> to the Per≈øon, who next under God had deliver'd them from their Continual fears of Fire and Sword. Nor by the denying him a little Gold to <hi>Heal</hi> with; which looks like an improbable Story of the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer's own framing. The≈øe are Motions ≈øo incon≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a King to for≈øake his Dominions, that the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer ≈øeems to have Conjur'd them up meerly to degrade the Courage of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting Monarch, and to mortify his own Di≈øcu≈ø≈øion. But after all, the Que≈øtion may be fairly put, whether <hi>Withdrawing,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction of our Law, does not rather imply a Guilt, than an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehen≈øion of Danger, unle≈øs it be that of being call'd to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ≈øince the Query always propounded to the Jury is, <hi>Did he fly for't?</hi> Which indeed ought to be the Legal Determination of this Di≈øpute.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41592:8"/>
            <p> However the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> goes on, and tells us, <hi>We are to ob≈øerve, that to abdicate an Office always ≈øuppo≈øes the Con≈øent of him who quits.</hi> And this he affirms to be the meaning of the Word out of <hi>Salu≈øt, Tully, Livy</hi> and <hi>Grotius.</hi> But both the Suppo≈øal, and the A≈ø≈øeveration are fal≈øe. For <hi>Con≈øent</hi> implies, that the Que≈øtion mu≈øt be put, Whether the Per≈øon will Abdicate or no? Which never was put to any Abdicator in this World. Upon a forc'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignation it has. But a forc'd Re≈øignation is no Abdication. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that <hi>Abdicare</hi> ≈øignifies to <hi>renounce, forgoe,</hi> or <hi>abandon.</hi> And the Motives to this Abdication are various, and generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing upon the Rea≈øon of the Per≈øon that Abdicates him≈øelf, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Condition of Affairs and the Circum≈øtances he is under. And therefore tho a Magi≈øtrate may abdicate with the con≈øent of others, yet he rarely does it out of a natural Inclination. Thus it cannot be imagined that <hi>Lentulus,</hi> one of the Con≈øpirators with <hi>Catiline,</hi> abdicated the Pretor≈øhip, with the Con≈øent of his own Will, for he was one of the mo≈øt a≈øpiring Men in the Univer≈øe; but becau≈øe he found him≈øelf ≈øo obnoxious that he could hold it no longer: Thus <hi>Sylla</hi> abdicated the Dictator≈øhip out of a Vain-glorious Opinion of Felicity that attended him, and to ≈øhew that he had ≈øuch an awe over the <hi>Romans,</hi> that tho he were a Private Per≈øon, no body dur≈øt call him to an Account for the Cruelties he had committed. Hi≈øtory tells us, that <hi>Diocle≈øian</hi> abdicated the Empire, for madne≈øs that he could not have his Will of the Chri≈øtians. How does the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> know, but that King <hi>James</hi> abdicated the Government becau≈øe he could not have his Will of the Prote≈øtants? <hi>Charles</hi> the V<hi>th</hi> abdicated the Empire, becau≈øe he found his wonted Good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had left him. <hi>Bernard Rasfield</hi> Bi≈øhop of <hi>Mun≈øter</hi> finding him≈øelf between two Grind≈øtones, the Per≈øecution of the <hi>German</hi> Prie≈øts, for going about to deprive them of their Concubines, and the Pope's Excommunication, if he did it not; abdicated his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality and Bi≈øhoprick, that he might be at quiet. La≈øtly, to ≈øhew that Abdication does not <hi>always</hi> imply Con≈øent, <hi>Brutus</hi> compell'd <hi>Tarquinius Collatinus</hi> to abdicate the Con≈øul≈øhip, only becau≈øe his <hi>Praenomen</hi> was <hi>invi≈øum Civitati.</hi> And then as for what the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer adds out of <hi>Grotius, That a Neglect or Omi≈ø≈øion in the Admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government, is by no means to be interpreted a Renunciation of it;</hi> there's no Body cen≈øures the late King for any Omi≈ø≈øion or want of Diligence in the Admini≈øtration of his Government, for he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41592:8"/> was too diligent indeed; and that Diligence was the main Grievance which di≈øgu≈øted the People; his Diligence to extirpate the Prote≈øtant Religion; his Diligence to ≈øubvert the Laws and Liberties of the Ringdom; and his Diligence to introduce Popery. And this Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, 'tis to be fear'd, was one of the main Cau≈øes of his Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Had he omitted more, he would have had le≈øs rea≈øon to have abdicated. And therefore it is a Vanity to infer that there can be no Pretence for an <hi>Abdication,</hi> becau≈øe the Word, as he ≈øays, <hi>always,</hi> that is very rarely, or never, ≈øuppo≈øes the <hi>Con≈øent</hi> of <hi>him that quits.</hi> For that it is not in the Nature of Man to abdicate Empires, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, Wealth and Honours, but there mu≈øt be ≈øome compul≈øive Rea≈øon within that moves them to it. When Princes find the Times and Con≈øtitutions of the Kingdom will not bear their Government; when Emperors grow ≈øtiff and ≈øtark with Age, and begin to feel the La≈øhes of ill-Fortune; when Ambitious A≈øpirers perceive they mu≈øt take other Mea≈øures to compa≈øs their De≈øigns, then they ≈øwallow a ≈øelf-denying Ordinance, and think it convenient to retire from the Cares of the World, or out of Harms way.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> ≈øays, <hi>We have but two In≈øtances with us which look like an Abdication ≈øince the Conque≈øt,</hi> which are in the Reigns of <hi>Edward</hi> II. and <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>both which were unju≈øtly depos'd by their Subjects.</hi> 'Tis true, they were ≈øo far from looking like Abdications, that they were no Abdications at all. For both tho≈øe Princes being under a ≈øtrict Confinement, it was impo≈ø≈øible for them to <hi>abdicate,</hi> unle≈øs they could have made their E≈øcapes. Therefore they were forc'd Re≈øignations, and con≈øequently formal Depo≈øals. Nor had the Queen or <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lanca≈øter</hi> any cau≈øe to declare the Throne Vacant, as having already taken care to fill it them≈øelves: And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tho≈øe Princes would have re≈øign'd or no, it would have ≈øignified little to them that were by Claim in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. But the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> has over≈ølipp'd one In≈øtance of a Perfect <hi>Abdication</hi> ≈øince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que≈øt, which the King would have certainly felt to his Co≈øt, had not the Pope and the <hi>Poictovins</hi> been his true Friends: and the Ca≈øe was much the ≈øame as at this Time. For the Lords and Barons of the Realm in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> having often de≈øired the King to re≈øtore them their Ancient Rights and Liberties, and finding nothing but Delu≈øions, re≈øolve no longer to be abus'd but betake them≈øelves to Arms. The King then lying at <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41592:9"/> him≈øelf too weak for the Lords, thought it no good way to proceed by Force but rather by Fraud, and therefore ≈øends to the Lords, that if they would come to <hi>Wind≈øor</hi> he would grant their Demands. Thither the Lords repairing, tho in a Military Manner (for they dur≈øt not tru≈øt the King's Word) he ≈øaluted them all kindly, and promis'd to give them Satisfaction in all they demanded: And to that Purpo≈øe in a Meadow between <hi>Stains</hi> and <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> call'd <hi>Running-Mead,</hi> he freely con≈øented to confirm their former Charters; and was content that ≈øome Grave Per≈øonages ≈øhould be made choice of to ≈øee it confirm'd. But the next Day, when it was to be done, he withdraws him≈øelf privately to <hi>South-Hampton,</hi> and thence to the I≈øle of <hi>Wight:</hi> Where it was concluded that he ≈øhould ≈øend to the Pope, acquaint him with the Mutiny of his Lords, and require his Holine≈ø≈øes help. In the mean time the King lay ≈øculking up and down for three Months together in Corners, that no Body knew where to find him; or which was wor≈øe, as ≈øome write, roving and practi≈øing Pyracy upon the Neighbouring Seas.</p>
            <p>Whether the Lords and Barons did in Words declare this to be a Vacancy of the Throne, is not material to enquire. Perhaps they were not ≈øo curious in tho≈øe Days: But what they did in Deeds, amounted to the ≈øame as if they had done it in Words. For percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them≈øelves thus eluded, they ≈øwore upon the Holy Altar to be reveng'd. And what Revenge that was likely to have been is ea≈øy to conjecture, by their ≈øwearing Allegiance afterwards to <hi>Lewis</hi> the French King's Son, and bearing Fealty to him till the Death of the King. Whence it may be inferr'd, That if a Prince in Ho≈øtility with his Subjects de≈øerts his Kingdom, upon any Account, They who are next to the Government are not to he≈øitate as King <hi>John</hi>'s Barons did, in expectation of the King's Return, but immediately to take care of the Common Safety, le≈øt they ≈øhould bring the ≈øame Ruin upon the Kingdom, as tho≈øe Barons did by their Delay.</p>
            <p>La≈øtly, If the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> will not be convinc'd by what has hitherto been ≈øaid, Let him examine the King's own words, and try whether he can pick out any better Con≈øtruction out of them then that which I ≈øhall make.</p>
            <p>Says the late King in his Letter to the Earl of <hi>Fever≈øham, Things being come to that Extremity, that I have been forc'd to ≈øend away the</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:41592:9"/> 
               <hi>Queen, and my Son the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>that they might not fall into my Enemies hands, I am oblig'd to do the ≈øame thing, and to endeavour to ≈øecure my ≈øelf the be≈øt I can, &amp;c.</hi> Expre≈ø≈øions of a di≈øponding Mind, and only full of Grief for the Di≈øappointment of the Popi≈øh Career. The King was afraid of the Queen, and his Son the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> as he calls him, and therefore deeming it convenient to ≈øend Them out of the way, believes him≈øelf oblig'd to follow them. 'Tis true, there might be ≈øome Rea≈øon perhaps for him to ≈øend Them away; but none to ≈øend away him≈øelf, not being under the ≈øame Circum≈øtances. For let it be Paternal or Conjugal Affection, or both together; What could be a greater De≈øertion than this, for the ≈øake of a Wife and a Son to leave three Kingdoms at ≈øix and ≈øevens? He ≈øpeaks of <hi>≈øecuring him≈øelf as well as he can,</hi> but mentions nothing of Danger; only leaves it to the Lord <hi>Fever≈øham</hi> and others to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume the Cau≈øes of his Fears. But certainly the apprehen≈øion of Danger can never excu≈øe a Sovereign Magi≈øtrate from the De≈øertion of his Dominions, at the ≈øame time ≈øtriving and ≈øtrugling under the Pangs of the Di≈ø≈øolution of Government. If ≈øuch a De≈øertion of his Territories in that forlorn and langui≈øhing Condition, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Tribulations of a Wife and a Son, be not a perfect Abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Territories, the Words <hi>relinqui≈øh, de≈øert, forgo, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, abdicate,</hi> have lo≈øt their Signification. Thus <hi>Ly≈øimachus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch, de ≈øera vindicta Dei,</hi> after he had ≈øurrendered his Per≈øon and Dominions to the <hi>Getae,</hi> for a Draught of Drink, in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a parching Thir≈øt, when he had quench'd his Thir≈øt cryed out, <hi>O pravum Hominem!</hi> that for ≈øo ≈ømall a Plea≈øure have lo≈øt ≈øo great a Kingdom. He would be thought very unfit to be the Ma≈øter of a Ship, that ≈øhould throw him≈øelf into the Sea, when his Ve≈ø≈øel and Cargoe were almo≈øt ready to peri≈øh. And I will appeal to the Lord of <hi>Wemm</hi> him≈øelf, whether if he were to try an Abdicating Prince upon this Point, with the ≈øame Huffing and Domineering as he did Inferiour Offenders, he would take it for a good Ju≈øtification to ≈øay, I had thought, or I apprehended my Per≈øon to be in Danger. Rather it becomes a Prince at ≈øuch a time to exert his Courage, and contemn his own, when the publick Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity lies at Stake, e≈øpecially when the Remedy propounded was ≈øo ea≈øy as the Convoking of a Free Parliament. But to withdraw at ≈øuch a perillous Conjuncture from the Application of his de≈øir'd, nay
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41592:10"/> almo≈øt implor'd <hi>A≈ø≈øi≈øtance;</hi> What can the <hi>Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer</hi> think of him≈øelf to deny ≈øo plain an <hi>Abdication?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I take to be the Opinion of the late King's Abdication, intimated by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal a≈ø≈øembled at <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> Decemb. 1688. where they are plea≈øed to ≈øay, <hi>That they did rea≈øonably hope that the King having ≈øent forth his Proclamation and Writs for a free Parliament, they might have re≈øted ≈øecure</hi> (as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs the King might al≈øo have done) <hi>in that Meeting. But his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty having withdrawn him≈øelf,</hi> &amp;c. they did therefore <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou≈øly re≈øolve to apply them≈øelves to his Highne≈øs the</hi> Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi> &amp;c. That is to ≈øay, The King having withdrawn him≈øelf from the Cure of the Grand Di≈øtempers of the Nation, and con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Abdicated the Government, they re≈øolv'd to apply them≈øelves to a more Skilful, at lea≈øt a more Willing Phy≈øician. Which had the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer more con≈øiderately di≈øcu≈øs'd, when he wrote his Di≈øcu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, would have ≈øav'd him a great deal of trouble and expence.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the Rea≈øons which the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer brings to prove that the King, before his withdrawing, had ≈øufficient Grounds to make him apprehen≈øive of Danger, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be call'd an <hi>Abdication.</hi> That which follows, being altogether grounded upon certain Statutes and Laws of the Land, to the knowledg of which the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer ≈øeems to be a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, is an≈øwer'd in a Word, That they who pronounc'd the Throne Vacant, under≈øtood the Latitude of their Power, and the Intent and Limits of the Laws and Statutes of this Realm to that Degree, that if nothing el≈øe, the Con≈øideration of that might have deterr'd the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer from the Pre≈øumption of appearing ≈øo vainly and ≈øcandalou≈øly in the World. Nor would I be thought ≈øo impertinent to tran≈øgre≈øs the Bounds of my own Under≈øtanding as he has done. For indeed, to tell ye the Truth, if the Di≈øcu≈ø≈øer ≈øhould come to a Trial at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter-Hall,</hi> I am afraid the Lawyers will certainly inform him that he has very much either mi≈øtaken or mi≈øquoted his Authors.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Cannot but admire at the Stiffne≈øs, not to ≈øay Ob≈øtinacy of ≈øome, in not complying with the pre≈øent Government, con≈øidering the late danger of Popery, and that an Arbitrary Power was exerci≈øed among≈øt us by our late Rulers, in a≈ø≈øerting their Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øing Power, by the Mercenary Judges declared to be Law.</p>
                  <p>You may remember in our late Conference upon this Subject, you pleaded in Defence of your ≈øelves, and others, the Obligation you lay under to the Oath of Allegiance, with your Sub≈øcription to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> contained in the 37<hi>th</hi> Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and the Fir≈øt Canon of the Church: but if it appear that all this is rather grounded upon Mi≈øtake, than any ≈øolid Reality, I will not que≈øtion your ready Submi≈ø≈øion.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:41592:11"/>
                  <p> Oaths I confe≈øs are very ≈øtrong Ties upon Men of Con≈øcience, and they are to be tenderly dealt with until that Prejudice be removed; give me leave therefore with Sobriety and Meekne≈øs to enquire, Whether that Oath be ≈øtill in Force, with the Obligation to it? if not, that Plea mu≈øt vani≈øh and di≈øappear.</p>
                  <p>And here fir≈øt, let me remind you of the occa≈øion of impo≈øing the Oath of Allegiance; it was injoyn'd to di≈øtingui≈øh betwixt Church and Court, Loyal and Di≈øloyal Papi≈øts, upon that honid <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder-Trea≈øon,</hi> which hath left a Stain of Villany and Cruelty upon that Religion, never to be wiped off: Read over the <hi>Anatomy</hi> of that Oath, made by K. <hi>James</hi> the Fir≈øt in his Book of the Defence of it; And what is there in it that can ≈øtick upon any Prote≈øtant? except that Clau≈øe of denying all Foreign Juri≈ødiction<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> Prince, or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate: And this you ≈øeem'd to hint at, when you ≈øaid the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was a Foreign Prince.</p>
                  <p>Will you be plea≈øed in an≈øwer to this, to fix your Thoughts upon that of the great Apo≈øtle St. <hi>Paul, he is excepted that put all things under him.</hi> So here, without Que≈øtion, the King may dive≈øt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf of all Authority and Power, and when this is done the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cea≈øeth, as if he were really Dead. The Preface to the New Oath is not an authoritative Abdication; but rather a Declaration of Matter of Fact, that the late King <hi>James</hi> hath abdicated. So that in fine the main of the Controver≈øy lies here, Whether the late King did abdicate? For, if he did, without all Que≈øtion the Obligation of all Oaths taken unto him is cea≈øed. In confirmation of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, I ≈øhall endeavour to make it clear that any King may, And ≈øecondly, That the late King did abdicate.</p>
                  <p>That Kings may denude them≈øelves of their Princely Power and Sovereignty, appears from what was done by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> and King of <hi>Spain</hi> at the ≈øame time, who did abdicate both; and his Subjects took new Oaths of Fealty to other Princes. Some of tho≈øe Times might que≈øtion his Courage, but none did ever except again≈øt the Validity of it.</p>
                  <p>May it not ≈øeem ≈øomething unju≈øt to deny this Liberty to Princes, when they find them≈øelves overcharged with the Weight of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to retire into a Privacy for the better enjoyment of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Peace and Quiet? But I pre≈øume no Man will deny this <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the≈øis.</hi> It remains to prove the <hi>The≈øis,</hi> That the late King did abdicate.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41592:11"/> 1. I will not dwell upon what was done by the Metropolitan, and other Lords of the Council, upon his fir≈øt withdrawing; they came into the City, and with the Lord Mayor ≈øent for the Lieutenant of the Tower, ≈øeize upon the Keys, di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs the Souldiers, place a new Garri≈øon there, and de≈øire the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to a≈ø≈øume the Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; Why all this, if he had not Abdicated? Upon what other ground dur≈øt they rai≈øe Arms, ≈øeize upon his Royal Fort? Or how can they excu≈øe them≈øelves from formal Rebellion and breach of Oaths, if this be not granted, and is not unpre≈øidented, That Princes ≈øhall take up their Scepters again, when they have laid them down. But to pa≈øs by this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I would willingly be re≈øolv'd by any Thinking Man, who≈øe Judgment and Te≈øtimony is mo≈øt authentick in this Particular; Whether I am to re≈øolve my ≈øelf into the Judgment of the whole Nation, in a full and clear Repre≈øentation in Parliament, or into the private Fancies or Opinion of a few Men? I remember what you once repli'd to this, That every Mans Con≈øcience is to judg for him≈øelf in point of Practice. But do you not know when, and by whom this Principle was exploded, whil≈øt ≈øome were pro≈øecuted for meer Matters of Wor≈øhip? And ≈øhall this be pleaded by tho≈øe Men who ≈øo vigorou≈øly have acted again≈øt it, when in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is ≈øo de≈øtructive of the Civil Peace? <hi>A Line and a Line is an Abomination.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did ever any Government upon the Pretence of Con≈øcience di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with Di≈øobedience in Things nece≈ø≈øary to its E≈øtabli≈øhment? And can any Man expect to be excus'd from taking the Oaths, which is the only Moral Security the Government can expect or require; and upon this very Pretence, which if allowed, all Kingdoms mu≈øt di≈ø≈øolve into Anarchy and Confu≈øion; Religion and Con≈øcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Common Pretentions of all Male-Contents. This may ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ≈øatisfy any ≈øober Rational Man, that is not re≈øolv'd to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Conclu≈øion, be the Premi≈øes never ≈øo weak.</p>
                  <p>Some there are that pre≈øume their Sub≈øcription to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in her Book of Articles, will not permit them to yield their Obedience to the≈øe Alterations. But if this ≈øhall prove a Mi≈øtake, and our Obedience ≈øhall be conformable to our Principles, will it not rather be e≈øteemed Peevi≈øhne≈øs than Con≈øcience?</p>
                  <p>To di≈øcover the Mi≈øtake, let us con≈øider when, and by whom, the Articles were compo≈øed; and refer the Practices of tho≈øe Times to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41592:12"/> Articles, as an authentick and clear Interpretation of them, and this al≈øo will vani≈øh like Smoak.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Articles were made, or at lea≈øt confirmed, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was a con≈øtant a≈ø≈øerter and maintainer of this Maxim, That it is lawful for a neighbouring Prince to relieve and defend the Subjects of another, when invaded in their Laws, Liberties, and Religion. Who was it that protected and a≈ø≈øi≈øted the <hi>Hugonets</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> again≈øt the Tyranny and Violence of their Princes? Was it not this Gracious and Heroick Queen? And who was it that protected the <hi>Netherlands</hi> again≈øt the Violence and U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations of the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Monarch? And was all this contrary to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Doctrines of our Church, of which ≈øhe was the Defender? Was not this defended, or at lea≈øt allowed of, by the Church-Men of tho≈øe Times? mu≈øt it be now incon≈øi≈øtent with the Principles of our Times? Do they bind our Hands, ≈øo that if we are invaded we may not crave the like Protection? Let any ≈øober ≈øcrupulous di≈ø≈øatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Per≈øon give a ≈øober An≈øwer and Re≈øolution to the≈øe <hi>Queries.</hi> The <hi>Dutch Netherlands</hi> erected a new Model of Goverment under her Protection, after they had ≈øhaken off the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Yoak.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let it be granted, what ought not to be denied, That the late King did abdicate, and that the Government did devolve upon the People, and the≈øe in a full Repre≈øentative of the whole Nation, whether in Parliament, or in a Convention, (it matters not which, whil≈øt that was a free and fair Choice) have con≈øtituted the≈øe to be our Governours; Are we not to pay and ≈øwear Obedience unto them, as well as their Predece≈ø≈øors? And if this were rightly weigh'd, would an≈øwer an Objection from that Declaration, in the Act of Uniformity, <hi>I abhor that Traiterous Po≈øition, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If after all this Men will fix all upon a <hi>Jus divinum,</hi> and fly to Scriptures, let them give plain po≈øitive Texts, for a general Form, with Rules univer≈øally relating unto, and obliging all Places and Men. If they cannot, let them confe≈øs that God hath left all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and People, to be ruled by that Government and tho≈øe Laws, which are mo≈øt ≈øuitable to the Con≈øtitution and Temperament of the People; and this I lay down for a Foundation not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown. But to An≈øwer: tho≈øe places which are ≈øo much in≈øi≈øted upon, that of our Saviour's, St <hi>Paul</hi>'s, and St <hi>Peter</hi>'s, we need to make u≈øe of that ab≈øurd A≈ø≈øertion of ≈øome of the Romani≈øts, That this was only enjoyn'd and to be performed until they had oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to make a Re≈øi≈øtance.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:41592:12"/>
                  <p> This would ≈øtain the Glory of the Primitive Martyrs. Not a forced, but a voluntary Martyrdom de≈øerves the Crown; however this gives a ta≈øte of the Loyalty of the≈øe Men and their Religion, to the maintaining of which the Popi≈øh Princes ≈øacrifice all their Power and Policy.</p>
                  <p>But for a more Sub≈øtantial An≈øwer, by way of Satisfaction to the≈øe Scruples, let it be duly con≈øidered, that the Primitive Chri≈øtians and we were under different and di≈øtinct Admini≈øtrations; they liv'd under ab≈øolute Monarchs, their Grandeur was won by the Sword, and confirm'd by a pure De≈øpotick Power; and therefore their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance had been unlawful, contrary to the Rule and Force of their Government: but it is quite otherwi≈øe with us. We are ≈øetled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>Gothick</hi> Model, our Princes make no Laws without our own Con≈øent; they are obliged to the excution of Laws made by our ≈øelves with their Con≈øent; they have no Power to di≈øpen≈øe with the breach of them by others, nor to invade them them≈øelves. This was own'd by the ≈øeven Bi≈øhops, declar'd by former Parliaments; ≈øo that no Man is bound to pay their Allegiance any further; Let <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> have what is <hi>Cae≈øar</hi>'s, and the Subjects what is theirs, their Laws, their Birth-right. In ≈øome ca≈øes Moral po≈øitive Duties are ≈øuper≈øeded by what is naturally Moral, as in the Duties of the fourth Command, ≈øo here. Tho Government in general be founded upon Nature, yet this or that Form is but po≈øitive; and if it be not con≈øi≈øtant with the end of Government, Self-pre≈øervation, Why ≈øhould not it be either altered, or fixed in tho≈øe who will pro≈øecute the right end, the Pre≈øervation of the publick Peace and Liberties of the People?</p>
                  <p>To what hath been ≈øaid, let me add, <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> the late King's retiring into <hi>France;</hi> if it amount not to an Abdication, it comes near unto a Forfeiture, and no Prince or State can have le≈øs Rea≈øon to indeavour to re≈øtore him to his Crown and Dignity, than that Monarch.

But whence come the≈øe Appren≈øions to be le≈ø≈øened? can we expect a perfect Freedom from the≈øe Fears, ≈øhould he be re-admitted to his Authority?

                  <p>Would you ≈øetter him by Laws? the≈øe have been, like <hi>Samp≈øons</hi> Cords, ea≈øily broken: Would you place him under Tutors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours?

However the≈øe would make him a Pri≈øoner, and no King. Should we ≈øubmit in hopes of another Opportunity; Would he not ≈øettle a Corre≈øpondence with Male-contents at Home, and Foreign Princes Abroad? and if he pro≈øper in the De≈øign, hath that Common plea, That his Promi≈øes are Void, becau≈øe made by him when under Re≈øtraint? And then, What will become of all that is dear unto us, Religion, Lives, Liberties, and E≈øtates? This is prevented by an Abdication; ≈øo that if he return, it mu≈øt be by Conque≈øt, and then he will rule by the Sword, we ≈øhall all be in the ≈øame Condition, lie under the charge of Hereticks, Rebels and Traytors; the Government chang'd from a regulated Monarchy into an ab≈øolute Tyranny, our Religion abrogated; we ≈øhall be ≈øold as Slaves, or burnt as Hereticks. If Men love Bonds and Impri≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Rapine and Seque≈øtration, Racks and Tortures, Fire and Faggots, let them continue this Humor and Aver≈øation; but if none of the≈øe be lovely, as indeed they are not, let us ble≈øs God who hath redeemed us from the Hand of our Enemies, and the Hand of all that hate us. Let us joyn i≈ø≈øue with the Divine Providence (which

                  <p>There remains one Prejudice, but no Objection ari≈øing from the vain Fears of ≈øome Men, that the Church begins to be ≈øhaken in her Authority, whil≈øt matters of Religion fall under a Di≈øpute, and no Convocation con≈øulted with.

            <p>I take for granted that you are fully convinced, that King <hi>James</hi> the Seventh, by his many Violations of the Fundamental Laws, by his endeavouring to e≈øtabli≈øh a <hi>De≈øpotick</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power,</hi> and introduce <hi>Popery,</hi> (tho he him≈øelf had confirmed all the Laws that were enacted in Favour of the <hi>Prote≈øtant Religion)</hi> has thereby ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the <hi>Con≈øtitution,</hi> and (that our Mi≈øeries might have no Redre≈øs from him) has left us in a time when we needed his Protection mo≈øt.

            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> Argument they made u≈øe of to per≈øuade ≈øuch as are and ≈øhall be cho≈øen Members of the <hi>Convention,</hi> That their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt to call back the King, is, That the Peace and Happine≈øs of the Nation cannot be otherwi≈øe ≈øecured, nor Factions or Divi≈øions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingui≈øhed. But what Factions do you ob≈øerve, but ≈øuch as they them≈øelves do foment, on purpo≈øe to di≈øturb our Harmony? all which would immediately die, if the Government were once ≈øetled on tho≈øe who de≈øerved it be≈øt: for then, if the≈øe Fops continued ≈øtill fond of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Tyranny,</hi> they would be cha≈øti≈øed, as Di≈øturbers of the Publick Peace. The Argument may very ju≈øtly be retorted; for if the King return, we will bur≈øt out into a flame; and <hi>England,</hi> which has already declared, will quickly be on our Top, an Enemy too Potent and too Numerous for us, tho' we were all united, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the Danger to which ≈øuch a Procedure will expo≈øe us, we cut off all hopes of an Union with that Nation, and thereby deprive our ≈øelves of an un≈øpeakable Advantage, which would redound to all ≈øorts of People, and would be the only means to ≈øupport an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veri≈øh'd and ≈øinking Nation. Neither is this the only Inconveniency, tho' it be a very great one; for if we ≈øtate our ≈øelves in oppo≈øition to <hi>England,</hi> by <hi>Re≈øtoring</hi> the <hi>King</hi> whom they <hi>Rejected,</hi> it is not to be doubted but he will u≈øe his uttmo≈øt endeavour to recover that Kingdom, the lo≈øs of which is ≈øo con≈øiderable. Now, ≈øeeing it were vain to ≈øuppo≈øe that the <hi>Scots</hi> alone were able to ≈øecond his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires, he mu≈øt needs have recour≈øe to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iri≈øh,</hi> who≈øe Religion will procure a more intire Confidence than His Maje≈øty can repo≈øe in any others. The≈øe therefore mu≈øt be received into our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øom; and becau≈øe <hi>Scotland</hi> is the mo≈øt proper place for Invading <hi>England,</hi> it mu≈øt be the Scene of all the Blood and Confu≈øion that this melancholly Thought gives us a Pro≈øpect of. And what treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can ≈øuch <hi>Sham-Prote≈øtants</hi> expect from the≈øe, who otherwi≈øe would have become their Friends and Allies?

The third ≈øort are ≈øuch as have been in≈øtrumental in the in≈ølaving their Country, and are afraid if they be called to an Account, they may be brought to ≈øuffer <hi>Condign Puni≈øhment;</hi> if ≈øuch cannot ≈øucceed in their De≈øign, they at lea≈øt hope to be overlook'd in a <hi>General Confu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> ≈øo they have nothing une≈ø≈øayed that may tend to their own ≈øafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and if <hi>Heaven</hi> fail them, they ≈øummon <hi>Hell</hi> to their Aid; not that <hi>Love</hi> to their <hi>Prince,</hi> but meer <hi>Ambition</hi> and <hi>Intere≈øt,</hi> drives the≈øe <hi>Criminals</hi> to ≈øuch Attempts; neither are they much to blame, if they are at ≈øuch pains to ≈øow Divi≈øions among us.

            <p n="1">I. FIdelity and Allegiance ≈øworn to the King, is only a Fidelity and Obedience as it is due to him by the Law of the Land; for were that Faith and Allegiance more than what the Law requires, we ≈øhould ≈øwear our ≈øelves Slaves, and the King Ab≈øolute; whereas by the Law we are free, notwith≈øtanding the≈øe Oaths.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:41592:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> II. When therefore by the Law Fidelity and Allegiance cea≈øeth, then our ≈øworn Allegiance cea≈øeth: for if Allegiance might be due by the Oath to one Per≈øon, whil≈øt by the Law it cea≈øeth to him and becomes due to another Per≈øon, the Oath then would oblige Men to tran≈øgre≈øs the Law, and become Traytors and Rebels, whereas the Oath is part of the Law, and therefore ought to be ≈øo interpreted as may con≈øi≈øt with it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Fidelity and Allegiance are due by the Law to King <hi>William,</hi> and not to King <hi>James:</hi> for the Statute of 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> 3<hi>d,</hi> which defined all Trea≈øons again≈øt the King, and is the only Statute to that purpo≈øe; now that Statute, by the King, under≈øtands not only a King <hi>de jure,</hi> but al≈øo a King <hi>de facto,</hi> tho not <hi>de jure,</hi> again≈øt whom tho≈øe Trea≈øons Lie: whence the Lord Chief Ju≈øtice <hi>Hales,</hi> in his Pleas of the Crown, <hi>p.</hi> 12. di≈øcour≈øing of that Statute, tells us, that a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and not <hi>de jure,</hi> is a King within that Act, and that Trea≈øon again≈øt him is Puni≈øhable, tho the Right Heir get the Crown: and that this hath been the common Sen≈øe of the Law, Sir <hi>R. S.</hi> (upon application to him about it) hath a≈ø≈øured us. And according to another Statute, 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>ch.</hi> 1. It is declared Trea≈øon to be in Arms again≈øt a King <hi>de facto,</hi> ≈øuch as <hi>Richard</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> was, tho it was in behalf of a King <hi>de jure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then by the Law of the Land, all things are Trea≈øon again≈øt King <hi>William,</hi> which have been Trea≈øon again≈øt former Kings, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ≈øame Fidelity, Obedience and Allegiance, which was due to them, is due to him, and by Con≈øequence may be Sworn to him by the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>Allegiance and Protection are always Mutual, and therefore when King <hi>James</hi> cea≈øed to Protect us, we cea≈øed to owe him Allegiance by the Law of the Land; and when King <hi>William</hi> began to Protect us we began our Allegiance to him.</p>
            <p>The≈øe Con≈øiderations, are in our Opinion, ≈øufficient to remove the Grand Scruple about the Oaths. If the di≈ø≈øatisfied Party accu≈øe the Convention, for making the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> King, it is not my Duty to judge tho≈øe above me, therefore I ≈øhall only ≈øay that if they have done ill, <hi>Quod fieri non debuit factum valot;</hi> and they of the Clergy ought not to cen≈øure their Superiours, but obey according to the Law and Doctrine of Pa≈ø≈øive Obedience.</p>
